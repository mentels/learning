## Maps

* map() - stands for a map of any size
* #{} - stands for a map of any size
* #{foo => type()} - stands for a mapy containing at least the key foo with value of type()
* #{ktype() => vtype()} - stands for a mapy containing at least the keys of type ktype() with values of vtype()
* #{any() => any()} == #{ _ => _} - a mayp with any keys of any values
* The idea is to construct a `-type` with a map with  several fields but different fields are used in different functions where the type is used.
